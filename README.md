# Prepaid Package Revenue Stream Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of the revenue generated by two telecommunication prepaid packages, **"Surf"** and **"Ultimate"**. The analysis focuses on determining which package contributes more to the company's revenue, with a heavy emphasis on statistical testing to draw meaningful insights.

The two packages are distinctly different:
- **Surf**: Offers a low starting price but has higher surcharges when the allocated data is exceeded.
- **Ultimate**: Premium package with a higher starting price but minimal surcharges for additional usage.

By rigorously testing the data, we aim to provide actionable insights that help the company optimize its pricing and package offerings.

## Key Objectives
1. **Determine Revenue Contribution**: Analyze the revenue stream from both packages, with particular focus on understanding which package—"Surf" or "Ultimate"—brings in more revenue for the company.
   
2. **Appropriate Statistical Testing**: Given the nature of the data, we ensure to apply the correct statistical methods, checking for normality and variance homogeneity before proceeding to either t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, in order to provide robust and reliable results.

## Methodology

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
The initial dataset comprised 500 observations. However, during the data cleaning phase, records containing missing values and those failing to meet specific inclusion criteria were systematically excluded from the analysis. This reduction in sample size underscored the importance of selecting statistical tests that account for potential limitations in data robustness. Careful consideration was given to ensuring that the chosen methods were appropriate for the adjusted sample, particularly in light of the assumptions underlying parametric and non-parametric testing.

### Statistical Testing:
The analysis involved the following steps:
- Testing for **normality** to verify the assumptions of the dataset.
- Applying **t-tests** for normally distributed data or **Mann-Whitney U tests** where normality wasn't confirmed.
- Focusing on identifying any statistically significant differences in revenue generation between the two packages.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, SciPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **GitHub** (for version control)

## Key Findings
1. **Surf Package**:
   - A significant portion of **Surf** customers consistently exceeded their data plans, resulting in frequent surcharges.
   - In many cases, these surcharges led to total monthly costs surpassing the price of the **Ultimate** package.

2. **Ultimate Package**:
   - **Ultimate** customers never exceeded their allocated data, calls, or messages, and thus never incurred any surcharges.
   - Despite the absence of surcharges, **Surf** ultimately generated more revenue due to its larger customer base and consistent surcharges for overages.

## Conclusion
The findings suggest that **Surf** is the more profitable package for the company, not because of its starting price, but due to its structure that encourages overage charges. While **Ultimate** offers a stable experience with no additional charges, **Surf** customers' frequent overage payments drive higher overall revenue.
